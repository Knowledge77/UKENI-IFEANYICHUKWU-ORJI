The rise of digital education has increased the demand for efficient Online Assignment Submission Management Systems (OASMS) These systems streamline the process of submitting, grading, and managing academic assignments, replacing traditional paper-based methods. OASMS enhances accessibility, plagiarism detection, automated grading, and feedback delivery benefiting both educators and students. With the growing adoption of *e-learning platforms* (e.g., Moodle, Blackboard, Google Classroom), research into optimizing OASMS for usability, security, and AI integration has gained significance
Several studies highlight the advantages and challenges of OASMS:  
- 1Efficiency & Accessibility
  - Systems like *Moodle* and *Turnitin* reduce manual workload by automating submissions and plagiarism checks (Smith et al., 2020).  
  - Cloud-based platforms (e.g., *Google Classroom*) enable real-time collaboration (Lee & Park, 2021).

Diversity in Online Assignment Submission Management Systems (OASMS)
1. Accessibility for Diverse Learners*
- Visual/Hearing Impairments
  Many OASMS platforms fail to fully support screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA) or provide video captioning, creating barriers for students with disabilities (Burgstahler, 2020).  
  Example: A blind student struggles to upload files when buttons lack proper ARIA labels.  

- Neurodiversity
  Students with ADHD/dyslexia benefit from simplified interfaces with minimal distractions—a feature often missing in OASMS (Seale, 2017).  

2. Cultural & Linguistic Diversity
- *Language Barriers  
  Non-native English speakers face challenges with unclear submission instructions or error messages (Zhu & Van Winkel, 2016).  
  Example: A Spanish-speaking student misinterprets a plagiarism warning due to complex wording.  

- Global Interface Design  
  Platforms like Moodle lack right-to-left (RTL) support for Arabic/Hebrew speakers (UNESCO, 2021).  

3. Socioeconomic & Geographic Equity*  
- Low-Bandwidth Issues 
  Students in rural areas struggle with large file uploads or real-time collaboration tools (Warschauer, 2003).  
  Example: A student in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot submit videos due to slow internet.  

- Device Limitations:  
  Mobile-first designs are critical for students relying on smartphones (World Bank, 2020).  

4. Solutions for Inclusive OASMS*  
✅ Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
   - Provide multiple submission options (text, audio, video).  
   - Use plain language and visual icons (Nielsen, 2012).  

✅ Cultural Adaptation
   - Offer multilingual interfaces (e.g., Google Classroom’s 100+ languages).  
   - Support RTL text and local date formats (UNESCO, 2021).  

✅ Low-Tech Alternatives
   - SMS-based submissions for areas with poor internet (World Bank, 2020).
